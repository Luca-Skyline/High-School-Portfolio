### Dungeon Dash (Utah TSA Competetion)

Click here to play [DUNGEON DASH!](https://calvinaawebb.github.io/dungeon-dash-game/)

Created for the TSA State Video Competetion, me and 3 other Sophomores created "Dungeon Dash", a puzzle party game. It allows two players to race, mostly blinded, through a maze of traps and puzzles in an attempt to reach the center before the other player. The dungeon has several levels and items you can use to your advantage - as well as puzzles that are not only tricky to solve but tricky to figure out how to solve. Consider the fact that the dungeon itself is really a series of mazes, and it becomes clear why Dungeon Dash it the ultimate puzzle within a puzzle within a puzzle game.

Our TSA team placed 3rd in the state for this project.

## C++ Projects

### Pig Latin Translator

Software that will translate English into Pig Latin. Can do one word, like a name, or entire sentences and paragraphs, as shown below. Uses more advanced, in-depth forms of Pig Latin, including the transfer of all starting consonants to the end of the word (not just the first letter), adding "WAY" if the word starts with a vowel, accounting for spaces, and removing puncuation that isn't important to Pig Latin (the idea behind Pig Latin focusses on the pronunciation of words, not their written form).
