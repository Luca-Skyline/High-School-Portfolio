## 2022-23 Programming Class Group Project (STAR CHESS)

Click here to play [STAR CHESS!](https://replit.com/@the-do-nothings/Star-Chess?v=1)

I was the primary programmer/developer on this project and head of the programming team. I did the main logic for the chess moves, check/checkmate logic, and rudimentary AI engine. For more info, check out the group's [dev repo](https://github.com/Luca-Skyline/SoundVision-Code). I divied out some of the other programming tasks to the awesome [Spencer Wood](https://github.com/swood136). Check out the GitHub for more info on my other awesome group members who did a great job with ASCII art and UI.

## Dungeon Dash (Utah TSA Competetion)

Click here to play [DUNGEON DASH!](https://calvinaawebb.github.io/dungeon-dash-game/)

Created for the TSA State Video Competetion, 3 other sophomores and I created "Dungeon Dash", a puzzle party game. It allows two players to race, mostly blinded, through a maze of traps and puzzles in an attempt to reach the center before the other player. The dungeon has several levels and items you can use to your advantage - as well as puzzles that are not only tricky to solve but tricky to figure out how to solve. Consider the fact that the dungeon itself is really a series of mazes, and it becomes clear why Dungeon Dash it the ultimate puzzle within a puzzle within a puzzle game.

I was primary code developer and in charge of audio assests on this project. Thanks, [Calvin Webb](https://github.com/calvinaawebb) (Project Manager), [Micah Tien](https://github.com/MisterNo0ne) (Developer), and [Jeffery Zou](https://github.com/HelloIverson) (Graphics Artist, Developer) for your collaboration on this project.

Our TSA team placed 3rd in the state for this project, qualifying for nationals.

## SoundVision (Utah Engineering Design Challenge / NEDC)

This project, done as an extension of the MESA club, uses an Arduino MEGA ADK and a lot a bit of C++ (via Arduino IDE) to perform a Fast Fourier Transform and analyze music. This project was done with Micah Tien and Jeffery Zou like the project above and I once again am very grateful for their help. Individually, I wrote the code and did the wiring for this project.

Our NEDC team placed 2nd in the state for this project.

### Pig Latin Translator

Software that will translate English into Pig Latin. Can do one word, like a name, or entire sentences and paragraphs, as shown below. Uses more advanced, in-depth forms of Pig Latin, including the transfer of all starting consonants to the end of the word (not just the first letter), adding "WAY" if the word starts with a vowel, accounting for spaces, and removing puncuation that isn't important to Pig Latin (the idea behind Pig Latin focusses on the pronunciation of words, not their written form).
