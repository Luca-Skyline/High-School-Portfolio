### Pig Latin Translator

Software that will translate English into Pig Latin. Can do one word, like a name, or entire sentences and paragraphs, as shown below. Uses more advanced, in-depth forms of Pig Latin, including the transfer of all starting consonants to the end of the word (not just the first letter), adding "WAY" if the word starts with a vowel, accounting for spaces, and removing puncuation that isn't important to Pig Latin (the idea behind Pig Latin focusses on the pronunciation of words, not their written form).
